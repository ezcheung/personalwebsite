      I've recently moved back stateside and am dearly missing all the tea, great bake-offs, and extraneous 'U's added to wourds.`,
      `In my free time, I try to stay active, primarily through ultimate frisbee and weightlifting, but I'm up for pretty much any sport,
      having competed at some level (often VERY casually) in tennis, badminton, mixed netball, table-tennis, basketball, and more while in high school or at university`

      gaming, playing with my 2 dogs Archie and Bishop, and binge-rewatching How I Met Your Mother and/or Arrested Development.
      Of course, I also like to use my free time solving coding challenges, learning about new frameworks and technologies, and 
      developing solo projects if I have any ideas I want to create, so if you have any cool ideas for projects and need developers, 
      don't be afraid to shoot me an email or a message on LinkedIn!`
