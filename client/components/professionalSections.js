    My degree fostered an efficient work ethic and skills in communicating ideas, both in writing and face-to-face. In terms of
    technical programming skills, I also completed a variety of Computer Science courses, including Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming, and Discrete Mathematics
    (a full list of CS courses can be found on my CV).`, 
    `However, while these classes did provide me with a strong CS foundation, my skillset was developed primarily
    at Hack Reactor Software Engineering Immersive. There I learned practical JavaScript knowledge and gained experience with
    building projects in teams. Hack Reactor equipped me with the skills for full-stack development in a variety of frameworks, which I have continued
    to refine through other projects, some of which can be found in my Portfolio above.`
